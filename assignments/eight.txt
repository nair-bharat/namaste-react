In React, the `super(props)` call is used in class components to explicitly call the constructor of the parent class (i.e., `React.Component`). This is necessary because when you define a constructor in a subclass (your React component), you must call `super(props)` as the first statement within your constructor. This ensures that the base class's constructor is executed before any code in the subclass's constructor.

Here's why `super(props)` is used:

1. **Initialization of the Parent Class**: React components extend the `React.Component` class. The parent class (`React.Component`) has its own constructor function that initializes various aspects of the component, including setting up the component's state, handling props, and other internal logic.

2. **Access to Props**: By calling `super(props)` in your constructor, you pass the `props` object to the parent class's constructor. This allows the parent class to handle props and perform necessary setup based on the props.

Here's an example of how you might see `super(props)` used in a React class component:

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class MyComponent extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props); // Call the constructor of the parent class

    // Your component-specific initialization can go here
  }

  render() {
    // Render your component here
  }
}

export default MyComponent;
```

In modern React (React 16.3 and later), you don't actually need to define a constructor just to call `super(props)`. You can use a class field property to automatically set the props without explicitly defining a constructor. Here's an example of the same component using this newer syntax:

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class MyComponent extends Component {
  // No constructor needed

  // Access props directly using class field property syntax
  state = {
    value: this.props.initialValue,
  };

  render() {
    // Render your component here
  }
}

export default MyComponent;
```

In this case, the constructor is automatically generated by the JavaScript engine, and it includes the necessary call to `super(props)` for you. This simplifies your code and makes it more concise.
